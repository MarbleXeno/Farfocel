# How to compile
### On Windows
You can use the 'build.bat' script to generate a Visual Studio solution and compile it or you can setup MinGW on your system and generate Makefiles to compile the project that way.
### On Linux
I didn't test it on Linux yet, so this might not work. You can generate Makefiles using Premake and then compile the project using Make.
### On MacOS
I didn't test it on MacOS yet, but the idea should be the same as on Linux.
